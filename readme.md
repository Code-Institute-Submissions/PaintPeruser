# PaintPeruser
A website where you can visualise paint colours before getting quotes.


## Site Owner Goal
The site is being set up for the owner to sell quantities of paint in specific colours to the user. The owner manufactures several paint varieties and would like the user to be able to visualise their colour choices on an image.

The owner would achieve this by allowing the user to control/amend an image, changing the wall colour to their preference, giving interactivity and driving interest.

Once their selection has been made, the site will allow them to email over a quote to themselves, calculating a quote value with instructions for further purchase. The site will also store their details within the browser cache for user ease of revisiting.
