# PaintPeruser
A website where you can visualise paint colours before getting quotes.


## Site Owner Goal
The site is being set up for the owner to sell quantities of paint in specific colours to the user. The owner manufactures several paint varieties and would like the user to be able to visualise their colour choices on an image.

The owner would achieve this by allowing the user to control/amend an image, changing the wall colour to their preference, giving interactivity and driving interest.

Once their selection has been made, the site will allow them to email over a quote to themselves, calculating a quote value with instructions for further purchase. The site will also store their details within the browser cache for user ease of revisiting.

## User Stories

### User A - New Customer
- A new customer has navigated to the website to look at paint.
- They will want to select from multiple colours.
- If the paint can be seen in context, it's more likely that they will commit.
- On choosing a colour, they will want to find out how much it costs.
- A copy of the quote emailed over to them would help cement the sale.
- Next steps for purchasing should be included on the email.

### User B - Returning Customer
- The returning customer will have visited or perhaps purchased paint before.
- They will be familiar with the website from the last time and expect a similar experience.
- They will want to select the same, or a new different colour.
- Their previous choices presented to them will make the experience easier.
- A price will be required for their consideration
- An emailed quote will allow them to continue the process as they likely did before.
